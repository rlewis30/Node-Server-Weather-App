This is a Node.js application that creates a node server that listens on all interfaces on port 3000 which serves a weather application.

The weather application makes AJAX calls to Wunderground's API's in order to retrieve weather data from the entered zip code.

To start the server, navigate to the directory that contains the application and type in node server.js. This will start the server. After the
server is started, type in localhost:3000, 0.0.0.0:3000 or the /'<'insert ipaddress of machine>:3000 in a browser. If you want to run the application locally just use localhost:3000.
